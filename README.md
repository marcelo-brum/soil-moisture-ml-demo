# Soil Moisture Prediction with Machine Learning (Demo)

## Overview
This repository presents a demonstration workflow for predicting surface soil moisture using satellite data and machine learning techniques. The project is inspired by my PhD research in agricultural engineering, focusing on data-driven solutions for water dynamics in agricultural basins.

To preserve the originality of a manuscript currently under peer review, this repository contains a **demonstration version** of the methodology. The full dataset and official scientific results are not disclosed here.

## Problem Statement
Monitoring soil moisture at basin scale is challenging due to the limited availability of in situ sensors and the uncertainties associated with satellite-based estimates. This project explores how machine learning can integrate multiple data sources to improve spatial predictions of soil moisture.

## Data Sources (public / demo)
- SMAP soil moisture products  
- ERA5-Land meteorological variables  
- Soil texture maps  
- Land cover data  

*(Public subsets or simulated samples are used in this demo version.)*

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Machine learning models:
  - Random Forest  
  - XGBoost  
- Model evaluation using RMSE and R²  
- Spatial mapping of predictions  

---

## Results (demonstration)
The demo results illustrate how machine learning models can reduce prediction errors compared to using satellite data alone, highlighting the potential of data integration for agricultural water management.

## Applications
- Irrigation planning  
- Drought monitoring  
- Risk management in agriculture  
- Decision support for watershed management
